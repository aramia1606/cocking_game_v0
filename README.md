# 🍳 Pixel Chef (Prototype)

**#GodotEngine #GameDev #PixelArt #OvercookedInspired #IndieGame #Prototype #GameMechanics #GodotSandbox**

**Pixel Chef** is an early-stage prototype of a 2D pixel-style cooking game inspired by the fast-paced chaos of *Overcooked*, but designed to be **simpler**, lighter, and more manageable for a solo dev workflow. This project focuses on building basic gameplay mechanics and experimenting with core features using the **Godot Engine**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `main_game` folder with the **Godot Engine (v3.x)**
2. Run the project and test the basic player control and interaction
3. Optional: open the `sandbox_project` folder to explore experimental features or test mechanics

---

## 📌 Notes

This project is a **learning experiment and portfolio piece** — it is not yet in a playable state, but it's intended to grow as new mechanics are implemented and tested.
